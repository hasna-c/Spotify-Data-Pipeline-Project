# Spotify Data Pipeline Project
A data pipeline is a series of processes that are used to move data from its source to its destination in a useful and meaningful way. A typical data pipeline involves several stages, including data extraction, transformation, and loading.

To implement a complete data pipeline using Spotify ETL,  first need to integrate with the Spotify API and extract the data . This could involve using tools such as the Spotify Web API, which allows  to access various data points about artists, albums, tracks, and playlists.

Once  extracted the data, then need to deploy the code on AWS Lambda, a serverless computing platform that allows  to run code without having to manage servers or infrastructure.  then set up a trigger to run the extraction automatically at regular intervals or in response to specific events.

After the data has been extracted, need to transform it using a transformation function. This could involve cleaning up the data, aggregating it, or converting it into a different format.Then build an automated trigger for the transformation function to run on the extracted data.

Once the data has been transformed,  to store the files on S3 properly. S3 is Amazon's Simple Storage Service, which is used to store and retrieve data objects.  S3 to store the extracted and transformed data files, making them easily accessible and secure.

Finally,  build analytics tables on the data files using Glue and Athena. Glue is an ETL service that allows to catalog, clean, and transform data, while Athena is a serverless query service that allows to analyze data using SQL.These tools to create tables that summarize and aggregate the data in a way that makes it easier to understand and use for analysis.
